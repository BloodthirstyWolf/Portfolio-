    <h2> 1. Puppy-proof your home </h2>

    <p>
Before bringing they home, it's crucial to ensure that your living space is safe and secure. Puppy-proofing involves identifying potential hazards and taking necessary precautions to create a safe environment for your furry friend. Here's what you need to consider:

Remove everything dangerous.

To ensure the safety of your puppy, it is important to keep any small objects and choking hazards out of their reach. This includes coins, jewelry, and small toys. Additionally, secure electrical cords and wires by tucking them out of sight or using cord protectors. Make sure to keep cabinets containing cleaning supplies, medications, and other harmful items securely closed with childproof locks

<div class="important-banner">
  To keep your puppy safe, use baby gates or other barriers to restrict access to certain areas. This will prevent them from entering rooms or spaces that may be dangerous. Install stair gates to block off stairways and prevent falls and accidents. Additionally, make sure to close off spaces like the laundry room or garage, as they may contain hazardous materials or tools.

Protect your belongings

Make sure to keep all shoes, clothing, and other valuable items out of your puppy's reach. To prevent your pup from rummaging through the trash, use covered bins. If your puppy is prone to chewing on furniture or other items, consider using bitter sprays or other deterrents on the corners of these items. This will help protect them from being damaged.</p>
