    <h1>Why Are My Plants Dying? A Quick Guide to Floriculture for Beginners</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, a dear friend presented me with a nice ivy plant, assuring me that it was the perfect companion for someone with little gardening experience. "Just water it occasionally" she said with a reassuring smile. Without further ado, it dried up after a few days. This happens sometimes even with professionals, including me, so don't worry too much. But I can help you make it happen as rarely as possible.</p>
    <h2>Tips for Keeping Your Plants Alive</h2>

    <p><span class="highlight">Water Regularly:</span> Ensuring your plants receive an adequate water supply is crucial for their well-being. However, it's important to pay attention to the quality of water you use. Avoid using water that contains high levels of salts or chemicals, as these can be harmful to plants. Instead, opt for clean, preferably distilled or rainwater. Regularly check the moisture levels of the soil to determine when watering is needed, as overwatering can lead to root rot and other issues.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">Fertilize:</span> Fertilizers have unfairly gained a negative reputation as harmful substances, but in reality, it play a vital role in plant nutrition. Think of fertilizing as providing a nutritious meal for your plants as we feed our pets. However, it's important to follow instructions and avoid overdoing it, as excessive fertilizer can be detrimental. Strike a balance by treating fertilizing for healthy and flourishing plants</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Prune:</span> Pruning is a vital aspect of plant care that involves removing dead, damaged, or overgrown parts of the plants. This practice not only enhances the appearance of your plants but also promotes their overall health. When pruning, use clean and sharp pruning tools to make precise cuts, minimizing the risk of introducing diseases to the plants. Focus on removing any diseased or infested branches, as well as maintaining a balanced shape for the plant.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Monitor Pests:</span> Pests can wreak havoc on your plants, causing damage and potentially even killing them if left unchecked. Regular monitoring is essential to identify and address pest infestations promptly. Look for signs such as chewed leaves, discolored foliage, or presence of insects. Depending on the severity of the infestation, various measures can be taken, such as using organic pest control methods like neem oil or introducing beneficial insects to combat pests naturally. Avoid using harmful chemical pesticides unless absolutely necessary, as they can have adverse effects on beneficial insects and the environment.</p>
