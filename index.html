      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">From an early age, my natural talent for languages became evident. Learning them came effortlessly and naturally, and when I sought to earn my first money in my youth, it was clear which path to choose. For a solid four years, I dedicated myself to freelancing, initially as a translator in languages like English, German, and Japanese. As time went on, I expanded my skills to include SEO copywriting.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">However, I eventually decided to step away from freelance exchanges, recognizing that it was an arena primarily for beginners, where success often hinged on delegating work to lower-paid individuals. I realized that I had outgrown the phase of needing just a little money for student entertainment; I had transformed into someone who desired personal and professional growth.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">As time went on, I realized that I wanted more than just financial rewards. I wanted to give back to society and contribute to the well-being of others. One significant step I took was joining an organization dedicated to helping individuals with serious mental and physical health challenges. Although it started as a small group of passionate individuals unsure of their direction, I contributed by translating essential resources, including an entire book that continues to be a valuable asset today.</p>
